# FFXIV Reference site

The entire reason this exist is because I want to have access to some quick reference material on my tablet and not alt-tab out of the game.

It's available at https://soktai.ca, hosted on [pico.sh](https://pico.sh/).

## Development

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
We're using the very simple [Hugo-Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.
Most of the FFXIV functionality are in a separate [Hugo module](https://github.com/tx0dev/hugo-xiv) for people to use on their own sites.

```sh
hugo serve --disableFastRender
```

For testing on tablet, pass the `--bind 0.0.0.0`, and check the firewall for port 1313.

## Deploy

We're deploying to a site then linking it to the main domain.

```sh
site_ver=$(date +%Y%M%d)
hugo
rsync -rv public/ pgs.sh:/ffxiv-$site_ver
ssh pgs.sh link soktai --top ffxiv-$site_ver
```

## Roadmap

Moved the site functionality to the [Hugo XIV module](http://github.com/tx0dev/hugo-xiv).

- [x] SBOM for SQEX assets
- [ ] Current extreme and savage guide
- [ ] Complete the ARR relic weapon (going through it right now)
- [ ] Basic game info, mostly mechanics
- [ ] DoL/DoH reference and powerleveling (Did CUL, just need to do the other)
