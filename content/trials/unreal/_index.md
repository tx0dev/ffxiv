# Unreal and Faux Hollows

## Unreal Trials
Unreal trials are new versions of familiar duties, designed to challenge players who have reached the current level cap by providing an experience of similar difficulty to the original versions of these encounters at the time of their release. These trials are numerically tuned by the developers with the current job changes in mind, compensating for alterations in abilities since the original introduction of the trials.

Due to the strict item level (IL) sync of unreal trials, it is not possible to outgear them as in a typical extreme trial. Therefore, players may find the DPS, healing, and mitigation requirements in unreal trials to be somewhat tighter than in the newest extreme trial (unless done using minimum IL settings).
